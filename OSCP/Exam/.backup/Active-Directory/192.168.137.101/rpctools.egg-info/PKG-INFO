The rpctools package provides client libraries for working with RPC services
with enhanced SSL support.

Currently the only protocol implemented is JSON-RPC.  The enhanced SSL
support is simply that these libraries can present client certificates
for authentication and can be set up to require a trusted SSL connection with
the server (validating CA and hostname matches).
